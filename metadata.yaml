    longDescription: >
      Portable UV-C Steriliser used particularly to sterilise common touch points in isolation wards and intensive care units of hospitals such as controls of fixed medical instruments, incubation, door handles, sockets, switches, and other surgical equipment. The process helps to eradicate viruses at a faster rate than existing disinfection methods such as fumigation and autoclave treatment. The design is open-source and is easily assembled using standard off-the-shelf components.

# Note that it's critical that a metadata.yaml file _does not ever have_ this trailing ---
# The reason: this trailing separator says there's another block to come.
# For a Markdown fine, that's true -- the main Markdown text
# But in a pure Yaml file, there isn't more to come - and it will break because empty!
